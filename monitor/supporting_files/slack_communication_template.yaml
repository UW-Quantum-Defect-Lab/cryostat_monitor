# When communicating between python and Slack, we need to either use
# webhooks or OAuth tokens.
#
# Webhooks are connected to a specific channel specified through the
# Slack application management website. Webhooks can only send data.
#
# Unlike webhooks, OAuth tokens can communicate with anyone within a
# Slack workspace, and are able to both send and receive information.
# However, these tokens require a server to run on, so as of Feb 2024
# we are not actively using them.

# Choose between the production or test urls in your python script.
# Here, we provide both for convenience. If you are having trouble
# using the webhook, chance are that it has been invalidated, and you
# need to make a new one.

# The Slack webhook link for regular everyday use.
slack_webhook_url_production: a slack webhook url
# The Slack webhook link for testing new functionalities.
slack_webhook_url_test: another slack webhook url

# The slack oauth token. Not currently implemented.
slack_oauth_token: an oauth token url
# The slack channel to send messages to (if the oath token is used instead of the webhook).
slack_channel: a valid channel name
